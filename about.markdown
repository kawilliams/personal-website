I'm a 3rd year graduate student working on my PhD in Computer Science at the University of Arizona. I currently work in the [HDC lab][hdc] and collaborate with [Kate Isaacs](http://hdc.cs.arizona.edu/people/kisaacs/). My research involves visualizing trace data from high-performance computers. 

Before attending the University of Arizona in the August 2017, I graduated from [Davidson College](http://davidson.edu) in North Carolina with a B.S. in Computer Science and a Math minor. I was a Division I swimmer in college and swam at the 2016 Olympic Trials in the 100m and 200m breaststrokes. I like to make swim visualizations in my free time, like plotting [Caeleb Dressel's accelerations](http://hdc.cs.arizona.edu/people/kawilliams/swim/dressel-acceleration.html).
