![Katy Williams](../images/kawilliams.jpg) 

I'm a PhD student in Computer Science at the University of Arizona, returning for my 4th year after taking a gap year. I work in the [HDC lab][hdc] and collaborate with [Kate Isaacs](http://hdc.cs.arizona.edu/people/kisaacs/) and [Alex Bigelow](https://alex-r-bigelow.github.io). My research involves thinking about how people think about data. I like questions such as "What if instead of imagining your data as abstraction X, you tried abstraction Y?" and "In your opinion, what is the most interesting part of the data?" 
I also visualize trace data from high-performance computers. 

Before attending the University of Arizona in the August 2017, I graduated from [Davidson College](http://davidson.edu) in North Carolina with a B.S. in Computer Science and a Math minor. I was a Division I swimmer in college and swam at the 2016 Olympic Trials in the 100m and 200m breaststrokes. I like to make swim visualizations in my free time, like plotting [Caeleb Dressel's accelerations](../swim/dressel-acceleration.html).
