### Overall Goals

- Overarching: Make HPC / distributed tools available for Python scientists
  - Solution involves distributed execution tree... therefore they need to understand that tree and how it relates to performance
    - Parallelize tasks on execution time
    - Rebalance tasks on execution time
    - Understand dependencies in execution time
    - Where are overheads coming from (Phylanx meeting 3/22/18)
    - How to choose between direct and indirect execution (Phylanx meeting 3/22/18)
      - possibly automatically or understand automatic algortihm (20190118-PhylanxPerformanceCall.md)

### Tasks

- overview
  - 20180420-A1Notes-PhylanxKickOff.md (add a minimap suggestion)
  - Phylanx skype 3/23/18 (someone will eventually want a timeline, but unintelligible at start)

- find hot path
  - 20180420-A1Notes-PhylanxKickOff.md

- find hot spots
  - 20180420-PhylanxKickoffTreeFeedback.md

- understand inclusive / exclusive time (broader goal: understand timing information)
  - 20180420-A1Notes-PhylanxKickOff.md
  - 20180420-PhylanxKickoffTreeFeedback.md
  - 20180727-PhylanxSmallCall.md (R1 notes timing is primary purpose)
  - Phylanx meeting 2/8/18 (perf counters)

- understand recursion (but no data yet exists)
  - 20180420-A1Notes-PhylanxKickOff.md

- view details
  - 20180420-A1Notes-PhylanxKickOff.md
  - 20180614-PhylWeeklyCall.md
  - Phylanx meeting 2/8/18 (primitive values on each node, perf counters)
  - 20190118-PhylanxPerformanceCall.md (on drilling down, R1 & P1)

- want to understand utilization
  - 20180323-PhylWeeklyCall.md
  - Phylanx meeting 2/8/18 (perf counters)

- follow dependencies
  - 20180323-PhylWeeklyCall.md (to find out why there is poorly used time)
  - 20180420-PhylanxKickoffTreeFeedback.md (to get the critica path after finding the hot spot)

- debug
    - 20180727-PhylanxSmallCall.md (P1 suggests finding all uses of a variable for scoping debugging)
    - Phylanx meeting 2/8/18 (want to see values of primitives on each node)

- export / save
  - 20180420-PhylanxKickoffTreeFeedback.md (R2 & R7)
  - 20181115-SC18MeetingWithLSU.md (R7)

- relate to code
  - 20180420-PhylanxKickoffTreeFeedback.md (R2 & R7)
  - 20180629-PhylanxSmallMeeting.md
  - 20181115-SC18MeetingWithLSU.md (they don't want original code though or C++ because too much going on, though R3 might want Python)

- find subset
  - 20180420-PhylanxKickoffTreeFeedback.md (R7 mentions filtering top of tree, zooming, finding particular function)
  - 20180621-PhylWeeklyCall.md (filter on locality, size of subtree, thread creator type)

- execution tree versus ast??
  - 20180420-PhylanxKickoffTreeFeedback.md (R7 “one is the crime scene investigation” and “one is the philosopher’s point of view”)

- compare two runs
  - indirect to direct time runs (Phylanx meeting 3/22/18)
    - also 20181115-SC18MeetingWithLSU.md
  - 20190118-PhylanxPerformanceCall.md (R1 notes 2 is sufficient)

- identify primitives of the same type
  - "bubbles of the same type" 20190118-PhylanxPerformanceCall.md (R1)
  - identify different types of task 20190201-PhylanxPerformanceWeekly.md (P1 when talking about Gantt)


### Visualization-Centric Observations:

- manage size of tree
  - 20180420-A1Notes-PhylanxKickOff.md (minimap, aggregation)
  - 20180420-PhylanxKickoffTreeFeedback.md (R7 & P2 debate tree collapsing)

- orientation (figuring out what entire thing means... this was done before code view)
  - 20180420-PhylanxKickoffTreeFeedback.md (How R7 initially interacts)

- identify common subtrees
  - Responses to my graph demos (not directly related to a task so this may be for de-clutter?)

- code highlighting
  - Phylanx meeting 7/19/18


### Non-Task feature reqeusts:

- Node aggregation
  - 20180420-A1Notes-PhylanxKickOff.md
- Handle recursive calls specially
  - 20180420-A1Notes-PhylanxKickOff.md
- Add a minimap
  - 20180420-A1Notes-PhylanxKickOff.md
- interact with other detail view
  - 20180420-A1Notes-PhylanxKickOff.md
- Juypter integration
  - 20180323-PhylWeeklyCall.md "they note this moves it from “some ... university project” to “oh, people can actually use this.”"
  - 20180420-A1Notes-PhylanxKickOff.md
  - 20181115-SC18MeetingWithLSU.md
  - Also github integration?
    - 20180420-PhylanxKickoffTreeFeedback.md
- Integration with MIL systems
  - 20190207-PhylanxWeekly.md
